# MFSF
Mesh-Free Shock-Fitting (MFSF) method for reservoir simulations

The purpose of this repository is to host our development of the mesh-free method for simulating multi-phase porous flow with shocks.
Our mesh-free method is based upon the radial basis functions (RBF) and we model the shocks with the "shock-fitting" method.

# ToDo
1. More detailed documentation
2. Re-write most code using C/C++
3. Parallelization using MPI
